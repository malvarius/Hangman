# Hangman

Here is a link to the hosted game:

https://malvarius.github.io/Hangman/


This is really just a for fun Hangman game I made using HTML/CSS and Javascript. If you would like to run it locally, just clone the repository and in VS Code or your editor of choice, open the HTML file in your default browser.

It is responsive, but requires a keyboard for inputs so will not work for mobile.
